training process of my models. However, it is not convenient to save the
statistics in a file for later inspection. Once the program is finished, we do
not have an overview of the training process. I am aware that there are
packages such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX">tensorboardX&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom">visdom&lt;/a>, which are specifically
designed for inspecting the various statistics during training. Right now, I
would rather keep the program plain simple and usable. So I decided to give
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html">Python logging pacakge&lt;/a> a try.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
